## About me ##
### I've always dreamed of mastering programming and creating websites and applications. It's always been interesting to me. After hearing about the recruitment for the Rs School preparatory course, I made an important decision for myself to link my life with the profession of "Front-end developer". Currently, I have completed the preparatory course and entered the 1st year to continue my studies and make my dreams come true. ###
